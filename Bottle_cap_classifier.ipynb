Each step is accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and functionality, providing context for the code and methodology used.\n",

        "The project culminates in the selection of the most suitable model based on performance metrics. Following the implementation, a detailed report discusses the rationale behind the chosen methods, insights gained during experimentation, challenges encountered, and potential avenues for improvement.\n",

        "When using roboflow, there is the option to prep the dataset (from preprocessing step until augmentation). Usually this is done when we are training on the model, not before. There are pros and cons on preprocess + augment dataset before or on the fly. The main pros is usually resource related, because we basically skip that step during training and has been prep beforehand. The cons is that the dataset will inflexible, if it does not fit what we are trying to achieve, the process is useless and we have to prep it again on the fly.\n",

        "For this project, I do the preprocessing and augmentation beforehand. My decision is based on the fact that I need all the time to train the best performing model. By skipping the preprocess and data augmentation on the fly, I can start training faster and save resources. Not only that, the preprocess and data augmentation that I am going to do on the fly has been done during the dataset prep step on roboflow. So preprocessing + augmenting data that has been done is a redundant task.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the preprocessing, I apply the Auto-orient step. It is used to re-orient images that may be saved in EXIF metadata. This is usefull to prevent bounding box misalignment due to EXIF metadata save.\n",

        "For the data augmentation, i mainly do the augment related to position such as rotation and shear. I do not do augmentation that is color related such as brightness and noise addition due to small dataset + color detection is also the main key in this project."

It comes down to preprocessing and data augmentation to fix this.

For the optimization, it has been tried to implement it but kept getting errors, thus the inability to use it. Another way is to upgrade the hardware or use additional hardware as complement. Upgrading the edge device spec or implementing gpu for the implementation may help it shorten its inference speed.\n",

During training, especially on a constrained resource, gradient accumulation could be an answer. It works by accumulating the gradient overtime rather than using it directly to update weight. This can help when trainig larger batch with small CPU / GPU.\n",

The result is a model with barely significant improvement. It is then concluded for this settings, this is the bottleneck and adding gradient accumulation may not solve it.\n",

        "Another way to optimize is through quantization. It is the act of reducing the precision of the numbers in the model. This may create a model that is smaller and faster inference speed with the same performance.\n",

        "Unfortunately, this method has been tested to fix the inference speed issue of Yolov8 model. This method is not used to an error that kept happening when authour tried to quantize a .onnx format model. Another avenue is to compare quantized .pt model with its .onnx, but that is for another day.\n",

The result is that the .pt model performs 2-3 times slower than its .onnx counterpart. Although both have the same performancem this shows that using the .onnx format is the right way to go for edge device deployment.\n"
