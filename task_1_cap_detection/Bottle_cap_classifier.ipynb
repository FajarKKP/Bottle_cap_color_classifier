Each step is accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and functionality, providing context for the code and methodology used.\n",

Following the implementation, a detailed report discusses the rationale behind the chosen methods, insights gained during experimentation, challenges encountered, and potential avenues for improvement.\n",

There are pros and cons on preprocess + augment dataset before or on the fly. The main pros is usually resource related, because we basically skip that step during training and has been prep beforehand. The cons is that the dataset will inflexible, if it does not fit what we are trying to achieve, the process is useless and we have to prep it again on the fly.\n",

By skipping the preprocess and data augmentation on the fly, I can start training faster and save resources. Not only that, the preprocess and data augmentation that I am going to do on the fly has been done during the dataset prep step on roboflow. So preprocessing + augmenting data that has been done is a redundant task.\n",

It comes down to preprocessing and data augmentation to fix this. Even then, over reliance on sythetic data is a dangerous scenario due to domain gap that can occur and unrealistic pattern learning.\n",

Although an experiment has shown it can improve, it feels the model just hit a bottleneck after the hyperparameter tuning. For new dataset, it depends on the client or resource available for new real-world dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yolov8-nano model issue is related to inference speed. THis can be fix by optimization or hardware upgrade. For the optimization, it has been tried to implement it but kept getting errors, thus the inability to use it. Another way is to upgrade the hardware or use additional hardware as complement. Upgrading the edge device spec or implementing gpu for the implementation may help it shorten its inference speed.\n",

        "### **Optimization Issue**\n",
        "Although the models are able to perform decently, there are some techniques that maybe can be tried to fix the issue. During training, especially on a constrained resource, gradient accumulation could be an answer. It works by accumulating the gradient overtime rather than using it directly to update weight. This can help when trainig larger batch with small CPU / GPU.\n",

        "Unfortunately, this method has been tested to fix the inference speed issue of Yolov8 model. This method is not used to an error that kept happening when authour tried to quantize a .onnx format model. Another avenue is to compare quantized .pt model with its .onnx, but that is for another day.\n",

The result is that the .pt model performs 2-3 times slower than its .onnx counterpart. Although both have the same performancem this shows that using the .onnx format is the right way to go for edge device deployment.\n"
