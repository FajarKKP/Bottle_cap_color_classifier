Each step is accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and functionality, providing context for the code and methodology used.\n",

Following the implementation, a detailed report discusses the rationale behind the chosen methods, insights gained during experimentation, challenges encountered, and potential avenues for improvement.\n",

The main pros is usually resource related, because we basically skip that step during training and has been prep beforehand. The cons is that the dataset will inflexible, if it does not fit what we are trying to achieve, the process is useless and we have to prep it again on the fly.\n",
